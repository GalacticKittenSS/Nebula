# Nebula

Nebula is A game engine based heavily on The Cherno's Hazel and is primarily an early-stage interactive application and Game engine for Windows. The repository currently follows along with the series made by The Cherno at [thecherno.com/engine](https://thecherno.com/engine) and will later be expanded upon to support 3D rendering and more!

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2019 is recommended, Nebula currently only supports Windows and no other development environments.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/GalacticKittenSS/Nebula`

Make sure to use `--recursive` to clone all of the submodules!

## Plan
The plan for Nebula is to create a 3D engine capable of handling beautiful graphics. The Engine will support both 2D and 3D rendering but Optimized for 3D Fast but Fancy.

### Feature Roadmap:
- Fast 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
- Native rendering API support (DirectX, Vulkan)
- Support for Android
- Fully scripted interaction and behavior
- 3D physics engine
- Procedural terrain and world generation
- Audio system
