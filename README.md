# Nebula

Nebula is a game engine based heavily on The Cherno's Hazel and is primarily an early-stage interactive application and game engine for Windows. The repository currently follows along with the series made by The Cherno at [thecherno.com/engine](https://thecherno.com/engine) and will later be expanded upon to support 3D rendering and more!

It is a passion project of mine and is intended to be used for small indie games made by myself once the engine is capable.

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 is recommended with only Windows currently supported. Nebula has no support for any other development environments.

1. Clone the repository to a local destination using git.

		git clone https://github.com/GalacticKittenSS/Nebula

2. Run `Scripts/Setup.bat`
	
		This will clone all the submodules, download VulkanSDK and create the visual studio solution

3. Open Visual Studio and build.

## Plan
The plan for Nebula is to create a 3D engine capable of handling small indie games. The Engine will support both 2D and 3D rendering, aswell as audio and more, in the future.

### Current Features
- Windows and OpenGL Support
- 2D Rendering and Physics
- Text Rendering
- Projects, Scenes and Entities
- C# Scripting Behaviour
- A "2D in 3D Space" Editor

### Feature Roadmap:
- Full 2D rendering (UI, particles, sprites, etc.)
- Fully scripted interaction and behavior
- Vulkan API rendering support
- Multi-threading
- 3D physics and rendering
- Audio system
- Animation controls
- Android device support
